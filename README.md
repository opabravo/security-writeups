Some security research during the internship at GSS corp.

Plus some writeups of Hack The Box CTFs in my spare time.

## Hack The Box

Hack The Box is an online platform allowing you to test your penetration testing skills and exchange ideas and methodologies with other members of similar interests.

### Goal

I am doing a self-challenge:

- 2 Machines a week
- 3 challenges a week

### Password

Active machine writeups/walkthroughs are encrypted with passwords, due to Hack The Box's rules.

Password is the flag(root) from the machine/challenge!

- Example: `HTB{flag}`

### Machine Writeup/Walkthrough

- [Soccer](./htb/Machines/Soccer.pdf)
- [UpDown](./htb/Machines/Updown.pdf)
- [Photobomb](./htb/Machines/Photobomb.pdf)

### Challenges Writeup/Walkthrough

- [A Nightmare On Math Street](./htb/Challenges/A-Nightmare-On-Math-Street.pdf)
